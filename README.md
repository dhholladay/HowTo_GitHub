# HowTo_GitHub
initial HowTos for GitHub vs Mecurial
adding notes: similar to mercurial but without the distributed part, all goes to and from a single server vs. being "threaded out" to your individual machine then "sewn back into" the server version
Local code files (your working code files) are kept on local drive
Desktop GitHup using Push does not seem to push a new version from local dir to GitHub
Nav to GitHub site >Repository>Code>Upload Files allows select files to upload from local dir
On Upload the new files of same name replace the old files and new files are added
Need to explore how to reference older versions of changing or replaced files
GitHub seems to lack a direct push function
